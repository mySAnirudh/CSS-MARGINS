  The margin property defines the space around an HTML element. It is possible to 
use negative values to overlap content.
The values of the margin property are not inherited by the child elements. 
Remember that the adjacent vertical margins (top and bottom margins) will 
collapse into each other so that the distance between the blocks is not the sum 
of the margins, but only the greater of the two margins or the same size as one 
margin if both are equal.
We have the following properties to set an element margin.
 The margin specifies a shorthand property for setting the margin 
properties in one declaration.
 The margin-bottom specifies the bottom margin of an element.
 The margin-top specifies the top margin of an element.
 The margin-left specifies the left margin of an element.
 The margin-right specifies the right margin of an element.
